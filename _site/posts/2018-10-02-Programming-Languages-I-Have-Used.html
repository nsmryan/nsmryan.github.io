<p>Like many programmers, I have used several languages for fun, for work, and for learning. I wouldn’t say that I know these languages, only that I have written at least a tiny thing with them.</p>
<p>I thought it would be fun to list them out, in some sort of order relating to how much I’ve used them, for the record. I will try to remember them all, but will likely miss a couple obscure ones.</p>
<p>I tried to include some examples of how I’ve used them as well.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>C</strong> for embedded stuff, flight software, user interfaces, and simulators</li>
<li><strong>C++</strong> for embedded stuff</li>
<li><strong>Haskell</strong> for personal projects</li>
<li><strong>R</strong> for data processing at work</li>
<li><strong>Python</strong> for personal projects and some for GUIs at work</li>
<li><strong>Ruby</strong> for use with COSMOS and once at an internship</li>
<li><strong>Rust</strong> for personal projects</li>
<li><strong>MatLab</strong> for work, creating a scripting interface to a camera</li>
<li><strong>Simulink</strong> for work, wrapping up a controls algorithm in a real-time system</li>
<li><strong>Lua</strong> for games, and once for a tool at work</li>
<li><strong>C#</strong> for a game in Unity</li>
<li><strong>Forth</strong> for fun with my Ti83 and Arduino</li>
<li><strong>Z80</strong> Assembly for writing a Forth for my TI83</li>
<li><strong>Game</strong> Maker Language for making a game</li>
<li><strong>Bash</strong> for odd tasks, as one does</li>
<li><strong>Perl</strong> for extracting comments from a codebase and creating a website to view them</li>
<li><strong>JavaScript</strong> for learning about web stuff many years ago</li>
<li><strong>Coq</strong> for a small project at school</li>
<li><strong>PHP</strong> for a project at school</li>
<li><strong>AWK</strong> for some simple text process stuff</li>
<li><strong>Visual</strong> Basic for learning in a class in high school</li>
<li><strong>Lisp</strong> for learning functional stuff, before I started learning Haskell</li>
<li><strong>Scheme</strong> for learning functional stuff, before I started learning Haskell</li>
<li><strong>Prolog</strong> for school projects</li>
</ul>
<p>Thats all I can think of!</p>
