<p>Yet another little Elm experiment!</p>
<p>This time I wanted to visualize quad trees. By far the hardest part of this whole experience was figuring out how to draw them. The mouse positions are received with the positive y direction going downwards from the top of the screen, the Graphics.Collage routines expect x and y to be centered in the middle of the screen (with y positive going up), and I structured the trees to expect the origin to be the bottom left (y positive going up)!</p>
<p>You can play with it <a href="http://itscomputersciencetime.com/elm/quad.html">here</a></p>
<p>The code is on my github repository in the Elm directory as <a href="https://github.com/nsmryan/itscomputersciencetime.com/blob/master/elm/quad.elm">quad.elm</a></p>
