<p>I did a simple little project recently that creates a gif visualizing the bit patterns within a file.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/nsmryan/Bit-Patterns">program</a> takes as input a file name, and outputs a gif consisting of colored cells whose brightness is based on how frequently the corresponding bit pattern occurrs. The bit pattern for a cell is just that the top left cell is all 0s, the next is 01, then 10, 11, 100, etc.</p>
<p>The gif moves from showing 2-bit patterns, then 4, then 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16. Of course, powers of 2 are the most interesting because the data is laid out that way.</p>
<p>One interesting thing is that the brightness is actually the log of the frequency- small numbers, especially 0, occur so often that just using the occurances directly leads to a white pixel for 0, and dark pixels for the rest of the image.</p>
<p>Anyway, I just wanted to do a simple visual of bit data. Also, now I know how to create gifs with Rust, which is cool.</p>
<p>There are some examples in the repo from <a href="https://github.com/nsmryan/Bit-Patterns/blob/master/results/main.rs.gif">text data</a>, which bunches up in the visual ascii range, and an <a href="https://github.com/nsmryan/Bit-Patterns/blob/master/results/git_pattern.gif">exe</a> which is more uniform. I also found that data files, like recorded CCSDS packets, produce nicer images then a corpus of english text, for example.</p>
