<p>I have been wanting to create some kind of simple computer art for a long time. Recently a coworker mentioned Processing to me, and I thought I would try it out.</p>
<p>The program I ended up writing was an exploration of calculating shapes implicitly by a function which takes a point and gives a vector to the surface of the shape. I wanted to do something with this concept as Iâ€™ve found it to be interesting for a long time.</p>
<p>There is a <a href="https://github.com/nsmryan/ProcessingParticles/releases/tag/1.0">github release</a> of the project with a Windows executable that you can download if you want to run the thing yourself.</p>
<p>The controls are simple- left clicking cycles through shapes, and right clicking changes the mode. The modes are: 1) particles move to random locations on the surface, 2) particles move to predetermined places on the surface, creating a very different effect, and 3) the same as 2 but cycling through shapes on a timer.</p>
<p>Thats all- its just a little thing to see how I liked Processing. I do like it, even though it is weird programming in Java again. I found that just getting things on the screen was very easy, which is my main concern for projects like this.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading!</p>
