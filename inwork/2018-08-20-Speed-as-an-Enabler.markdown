title: Speed as an Enabler
author: Noah Ryan

I wanted to write something about this phenomenon where the speed of a program
can be a pervasive effect on how something thinks and works. This is not a novel
thought, but it is an interesting one.


Very often, we discourage focusing on speed- computers are fast, and programs are
often fast enough. Micro optimization often does not have the intended effect, 
especially if it is not tied to some measurements, and things that seem fast can
be slow. Even with all of things, there are examples where speed is a deciding factor.


This seems to come up mostly in tools and algorithm heavy code- Linus Torvalds has
talked about how git changes the way to develop software by making branching fast,
Jonathan Blow puts in a lot of effort to make sure his language Jai compiles quickly, 
Haskellers often complain of the long compiles times,
