title: Rust, Restrictions, and Programming Domains

Recently Jonathan Blow posted an [interesting video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t1K66dMhWk)
with a well-considered reaction to the closing keynote to RustConf on Rust for game programming.


Jonathan Blow talked about how the tradeoffs made by Rust related to his domain of
programming, games, and I thought it would be interesting to talk about how I feel
within my own domain of aerospace systems.


First of all, I appreciate that he went out of his way to be clear that he wasn't trying
to be inflamitory, but rather that he wanted to consider the opinion presented in the
RustConf video, point out some subtlties he saw in the situation, relate his experience
with different designs, and talk about the pragmatic aspects and tradeoffs being made.
