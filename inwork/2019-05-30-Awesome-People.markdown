There are some people whose work I have admired over the years. This post
provides some links to their work. I wrote a similar post at the start of this
blog, but this one is more comprehensive.


I've learned so much from these people's work, so this is a small way to honor them
by providing other people a reference to learn and grow through the same material.


  * Edward Kmett does a great deal of Haskell. He has written an impressive number
    of impressive programs over time. He has a [blog]("http://comonad.com/reader/),
    writing on [School of Haskell](https://www.schoolofhaskell.com/user/edwardk),
    a [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCE3MJbkTVLoK8dAq7Del8ww), a
    [twitch account](https://www.twitch.tv/ekmett), [github](https://github.com/ekmett),
    and other media.
  * Dan Piponi writes about Physics, Haskell, and general math topics.
    His [blog](http://blog.sigfpe.com/) is incredible, and he has done some really cool talks
    with a recent one on stable [fluids](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=766obijdpuU).
    His [twitter](https://twitter.com/sigfpe?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor)
    has some amazing entries on math and physics.
  * Conal Elliot writes some amazing Haskell. He seems to break down every topic he thinks about
    into a beautiful underlying formulation, and then rebuilds it from this. Its amazing every time.
  * [Tom7](http://tom7.org/), aka Tom Murphy the 7th, has made many amazing things. My very favorite
    is a general AI for playing NES games.
  * Jonathan Blow is a very interesting game developer. He is making a language called Jai,
    and his games are like nothing I have seen. He streams on [twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/naysayer88/clips?filter=clips&range=7d),
    a [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCuoqzrsHlwv1YyPKLuMDUQ), a 
    [blog](http://the-witness.net/news/category/engine-tech/), an 
    [older blog](http://number-none.com/blow/blog/), and other media.
  * Raph Levien has some very good work in graphics, text editors, and music synth.
    His [blog](https://levien.com/) has some very in depth technical entries.
  * Matt Keeter has great blog posts and projects. Some of the font rendering and contraint solving
    stuff is inspiring to me. His webpage has great [projects](https://www.mattkeeter.com/projects/),
    [blog posts](https://www.mattkeeter.com/blog/).
