      <p>This blog has been a project in itself for me. I was inspired by Chris Done's <a href="http://chrisdone.com/posts/hakyll-and-git-for-you-blog">blog</a> which sets up a nice workflow for a static site.
I wanted to include Haskell in more of my projects, so having a site generated by Haskell was a big incentive.</p>
<p>This blog is generated by Hakyll, hosted on Linode by an Apache server, and stored on <a href="https://github.com/nsmryan/itscomputersciencetime.com/">github</a></p>
<p>The server setup was perhaps the most difficult for me, so I took the easy way out and installed one of the pre-made configurations available for linode which installs a LAMP stack.
The only configuration change I made was in /etc/apache2/sites-available/ where I set the default directory to /var/www/itscomputersciencetime.com.</p>
<p>The Hakyll part is fairly easy. I created a cabal file (so I can use cabal sandboxes) but the main thing is just building and running the sample Hakyll file. At least initially I have made no changes to the sample site and sample site generating code.</p>
<p>The Hakyll preview command is quite useful for checking out posts before committing them. Once they look the way I want, I commit them to github and then pull them from the linode server. This isn't as fancy as Chris Done's approach, which was more automated and worth looking at.</p>
<p>Finally, on the linode server I build the site into the _sites directory which is a symlink to /var/www/itscomputerscience.com.</p>
<p>This process is more complex then I would like. I need to perform multiple steps before adding a post, which will likely turn out to be too much work. I would like to do everything locally and have the site update and build itself.</p>
<p>Thats it for now. I'm glad to be blogging again, and this time with a personalized setup that involves Haskell.</p>
