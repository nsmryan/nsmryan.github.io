    <div class="post-content">
      <p>This post is about a <a href="https://github.com/nsmryan/CCSDS-Router">CCSDS packet routing tool</a> I've been writing in Rust. 
The motivation here is to provides a tool for moving CCSDS packets from one place to another, either from a file/TCP socket/
UDP socket to a file/TCP socket/UDP socket. I often have CCSDS packets in one of these forms, either stored or streaming,
and I want them to be in another (recorded to a file or streamed to a destination). When doing this, I sometimes want to
delay packets, throttle packets, or replay them according to their timestamp, such as when replaying captured data
during a test.</p>
<p>The use cases that I had when writing this:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You have stored packets in a file, and you want to replay them according to a timestamp within the packet.
This can be used for testing, such as to replay sensor data, or to test other tools by sending CCSDS packets to
them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You want to save CCSDS from a network interface to a file.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You want to route CCSDS packets from a TCP or UDP port to another TCP or UDP port.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You want to delay packets by a fixed amount. This could be used to simulate a delay that would be experience in operation,
but not in testing. Introducing this delay can expose issues in timeouts, for example, that would otherwise be seen first
during operations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You want to throttle packet delivery such that packets are received no faster then a given rate. This might help, for example,
with ensuring commands are not received faster then the maximum allowed rate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You want to do one of the above, while filtering for a subset of APIDs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You have regular CCSDS packets, or packets with a header and/or a footer of fixed size. The tool also supports packets
that are not CCSDS, but they must be of fixed length for it to know how to find the next packet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You have a mixture of packets from a source, and you want to forward packets with certain APIDs to certain sinks. For example,
you might store all packets in a file for logging, forward some packets to a visuzlizer program, and forward all packets to a
ground system. You might also want to extract packets with a particular APID from a file, so you read from a file to another file,
filtering for packets with that APID.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>One thing to note about using this tool- as of today (02/23/2019) I have tested this tool with real data, but it have not been battle
tested. I know it has some rough edges, and I expect it will not cover all cases that one might see in production- it needs some
testing and production use before I would use it as a trusted part of a system. I would certainly use it for testing and development,
and fix up anything I find, and I hope someone out there might do the same.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading!</p>
