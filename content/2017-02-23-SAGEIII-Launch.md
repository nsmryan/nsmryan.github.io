The SAGE III payload launched on SpaceX CRS-10 last weekend. I worked on the software for the flight computer for this payload, the IAM, and I got to see the launch.o

Check out the technical webcast from SpaceX (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rUDLxFUMC9c) at 25:03.
You can see the SAGE III Payload inside the Dragon trunk, along with the NVP that the payload mounts to. Its really incredible to see.
