This time I wanted to do something with the mouse cursor. This little program just draws a trail
after the mouse cursor as you move it.


You can play with it  [here](http://itscomputersciencetime.com/elm/cursortrail.html)

The code is on my github repository in the Elm directory as
[cursortrail.elm](https://github.com/nsmryan/itscomputersciencetime.com/blob/master/elm/cursortrail.elm)
