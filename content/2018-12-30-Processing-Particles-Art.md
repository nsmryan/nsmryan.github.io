I have been wanting to create some kind of simple computer art for a long time. Recently
a coworker mentioned Processing to me, and I thought I would try it out. 

The program I ended up writing was an exploration of calculating shapes implicitly by a function which
takes a point and gives a vector to the surface of the shape. I wanted to do something with this
concept as I've found it to be interesting for a long time.


There is a [github release](https://github.com/nsmryan/ProcessingParticles/releases/tag/1.0) of the project
with a Windows executable that you can download if you want to run the thing yourself.


The controls are simple- left clicking cycles through shapes, and right clicking changes the mode. The modes are:
1) particles move to random locations on the surface, 2) particles move to predetermined places on the surface, creating
a very different effect, and 3) the same as 2 but cycling through shapes on a timer.



Thats all- its just a little thing to see how I liked Processing. I do like it, even though it is weird programming
in Java again. I found that just getting things on the screen was very easy, which is my main concern for projects
like this.


Thanks for reading!
