The ItsComputerScienceTime.com blog is back! After a crazy long time of problems, 
a lack of interest in using Hakyll (I no longer write Haskell), moving to hover.com and netlify
from github pages, and just not knowing what to do, the ol' blog is back.


Ultimately I couldn't have done it without the help of my college, who helped me through problems
with https, DNS, and setting up automatic builds. Now the blog should be easier for me then ever-
I just write posts and commit then. I don't want to manage things myself anymore- I just want to write
posts.


Hopefully this means new posts- I have a long list from this last ~year!


It is now time... for computer science.
