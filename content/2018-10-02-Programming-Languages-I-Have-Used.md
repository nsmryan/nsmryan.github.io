title = "Programming Languages I Have Used"
+++
Like many programmers, I have used several languages for fun, for work, and for learning.
I wouldn't say that I know these languages, only that I have written at least a tiny thing
with them. 


I thought it would be fun to list them out, in some sort of order relating to how much I've used
them, for the record. I will try to remember them all, but will likely miss a couple obscure ones.


I tried to include some examples of how I've used them as well.


* **C** for embedded stuff, flight software, user interfaces, and simulators
* **C++** for embedded stuff
* **Haskell** for personal projects
* **R** for data processing at work
* **Python** for personal projects and some for GUIs at work
* **Ruby** for use with COSMOS and once at an internship
* **Rust** for personal projects
* **MatLab** for work, creating a scripting interface to a camera
* **Simulink** for work, wrapping up a controls algorithm in a real-time system
* **Lua** for games, and once for a tool at work
* **C#** for a game in Unity
* **Forth** for fun with my Ti83 and Arduino
* **Z80** Assembly for writing a Forth for my TI83
* **Game** Maker Language for making a game
* **Bash** for odd tasks, as one does
* **Perl** for extracting comments from a codebase and creating a website to view them
* **JavaScript** for learning about web stuff many years ago
* **Coq** for a small project at school
* **PHP** for a project at school
* **AWK** for some simple text process stuff
* **Visual** Basic for learning in a class in high school
* **Lisp** for learning functional stuff, before I started learning Haskell
* **Scheme** for learning functional stuff, before I started learning Haskell
* **Prolog** for school projects


Thats all I can think of!
