There is an awesome power [here](https://iquilezles.org/www/articles/floatingbar/floatingbar.htm) by Inigo Quilez
which develops his idea of a "floating bar" number. The core idea is to create a representation of rational
numbers that mimicks the "floating" property of floating points numbers.


Its an amazing article, and while he develops the concept throughly, more work on this seems like it could be
fruitful. The investigation for this article is related to graphics rendering, but I can't help work happens
to other applications when floating point numbers are replaced by floating bar numbers. I imagine there
are certain applicatiosn out there where a floating bar could fit better then a floating point.


Anyway, I just wanted to put a link to this post on my blog because I love these alternative view of common
things, and I love thinking about the alternate world they imply.


Enjoy!
