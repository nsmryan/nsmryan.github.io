A third elm program!

Try pressing any key to split the line as it grows.


The program is [here](http://itscomputersciencetime.com/elm/split.html)

The code is on my github repository in the Elm directory as
[split.elm](https://github.com/nsmryan/itscomputersciencetime.com/blob/master/elm/split.elm)

Have fun.
