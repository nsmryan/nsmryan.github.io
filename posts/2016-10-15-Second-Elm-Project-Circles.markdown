title: Second Elm Project- Circles
author: Noah Ryan
---

I have another little Elm program up. This one just animates some circles with
random sizes and colors. The most interesting thing about it is that it randomly
chooses among a group of transformations that it applies to a preset list of base colors.

This means that the colors are always new and always take characteristics of the hard coded
palette that I came up with.

The code is on my github repository in the Elm directory as
[circles.elm](https://github.com/nsmryan/itscomputersciencetime.com/blob/master/elm/circles.elm)
