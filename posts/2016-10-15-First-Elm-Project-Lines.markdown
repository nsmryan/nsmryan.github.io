I have been playing around with elm recently, and I put my first project up on this site.

You can see it [here](http://itscomputersciencetime.com/elm/lines.html)

The code is in the elm directory of the github repository for
[this site](https://github.com/nsmryan/itscomputersciencetime.com/tree/master/elm)

Enjoy!
